# Coffee Rating Prediction

This project aims to predict coffee ratings based on various attributes and identified notes. We will experiment with three machine learning methods:

- Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) network using PyTorch
- Decision Tree
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

The goal is to train models that can accurately predict the rating of coffee samples.

## Project Structure

- `data/` - Contains datasets for training and testing
- `train.ipynb` - Main notebook for model training and evaluation
- `data_preprocessing.ipynb` - Notebook for data cleaning and preprocessing

## Getting Started

More details and instructions will be added as the project progresses.
